## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
puts states[1]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
puts states.keys [0, 1, 2]
puts states.values [0, 1, 2]

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?

Hashes can be better than array when you need a string and value to be attached together.  It gives you the ability to link a string and a number



1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
How do we actually use these things to make functional software?
